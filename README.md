# **Olivia Woodruff Portfolio**

In this project, we'll use our knowledge of CSS visual rules to create rule sets and improve the appearance of a photography portfolio site!

<bt>

# **Tasks**

#### **1. Make the header's background color to CornflowerBlue**
Look over **index.html** to review the different HTML elements we have to work with, then navigate to **style.css**.

Start by making the `header` section stand out a bit more. Select the `.header` element, and make its background color `CornflowerBlue` by using the `background-color` property.

<br>

#### **2. Now change the text is aligned in the top .header section**

In our `.header` rule set, align the text in the center using the `text-align` property.

<br>

#### **3. Set the font-size of .about-me element to 20px**
Next, use CSS to make the paragraph below Olivia's name have a larger text size.

In **style.css**, select the `.about-me` element, and set its `font-size` property to `20px`.

<br>

#### **4. Use the opacity property to make the .about-me selector to 50% transparent**
The `.about-me` paragraph looks a little dark against the light blue background, maybe it would look nice if it blended more with the background.

Within the `.about-me` selector, use the `opacity` property to make it **50% transparent**.

<br>

#### **5. In the Projects section, make the section titles bold**

Select the `.title` elements, and add a `font-weight` property to make their text `bold`.

<br>

#### **6. Set the color for h1 elements to Azure**
_Change the main title color so that it matches the background color more nicely._

Set the `color` for `h1` elements to `Azure`.

<br>

#### **7. Change the font of the entire page into Georgia**
Instead of the page being in the default **Times** font, change the font of the entire page.

Select the `body` element and make the `font-family` of the page `Georgia`.

<br>

#### **8. Set the background-image property to the attached URL**
_Finally, let's make the background of the page more interesting._

Within the `body` selector, set the `background-image` property to this `URL`:

#### **9. Extra Tasks**

_Great work! Feel free to keep coding and edit the visual rules to personalize the site's appearance!_
