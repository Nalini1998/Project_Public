# **The Box Model: Davie's Burgers**

In this Project, we will step-by-step to fix a fictional restaurant's website. All of the HTML and most of the CSS is intact, but the box model properties have yet to be set. we'll use knowledge of height, width, padding, border, and margin to complete this Project.

The website's existing **index.html** and **style.css** files are displayed in the text editor to the right. As we work, use both to see which elements we are selecting and styling. Most of the elements that we'll need to add styles for already have rule sets in **style.css** to which we can add additional declarations.

# **Tasks**


#### **1. Styling the nav element containing the logo and navigation elements**
_We'll go through Davie's Burger's menu item roughly from top to bottom. Let's begin with styling the `<nav>` element containing the logo and navigation elements._

- Set the `width` of the `img` to `180` pixels.
- Center the `img` horizontally using the `margin` property.

<br>

#### **2. Set margin of span elements inside the nav**

- 10 pixels on the top and bottom, and
- 0 pixels on the left and right.

<br>

#### **3. Now set some rules for the element with the class content**
This element is a container for all the elements not included in `<nav>`.

- Set the `height` to `500` pixels.
- Create `10px` vertical margins and `auto` horizontal margins.
- Set `.body` elements inside `.content` to have no vertical margin and automatic horizontal margins so that it is centered.

<br>

#### **4. Make .content scrollable with the overflow property**

With a 500-pixel height for `.content`, some elements will overflow out of its box if the browser window is made too small.

- Make `.content` scrollable with the overflow property.
- Resize the browser window so it is very skinny and notice that this section is now scrollable.

<br>

#### **5. Now it's time to tackle the .header and its h1 text: "BBQ BACON BURGER"**

- Set the `height` of the `.header` class to `320` pixels.
- Create a `20px` `padding` for the `h1` element inside the `.header`.
- Set vertical margins to `0` pixels and the horizontal margins to be determined `auto` for the same `h1` element.

<br>

#### **6. Now add some box-model formatting to the ‘ORDER NOW’ .button element**

_As we make each change, make sure to scroll down if necessary to view the effect on the button._

- Set the `width` to `200` pixels.
- Set the `padding` to `20` pixels.
- Set the vertical margins to `40` pixels and the horizontal margins to `auto`.
- Give the `button` a `1px, solid, blue` `border`.

<br>

#### **7. Finally, style the nutrition facts section at the bottom**

In the element selected with `ul.nutrition`:

- Set the padding of the `ul.nutrition` element to `20px`.
- Set the `width` of `li` elements within the `ul.nutrition` to `200px`;
- Set a `10px` vertical `padding` and `20px` horizontal `padding` to the same elements.
- Add a `3px` `bottom` `margin` to the same elements.

<br>

#### **8. Good job**

_Our menu item is looking great, and the lawet and spacing is much more readable._

_If would like, we can continue refining the design or add our own spin!_
