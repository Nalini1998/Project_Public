# **PUBLIC PROJECT FOR REFERENCE**

<br>

## **For Your Information**
Here is the Codespace for all my Public Project; Theories; Issues; Discussions, etc...

## **I. JavaScript**
**JavaScript**, also called **JS**, is a flexible and powerful language that is implemented consistently by various _web browsers_, making it the language for _web development_. **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS** are the **core components** of _web technology_;

While **HTML** is responsible for _structure_ and **CSS** is responsible for _style_, **JavaScript** provides _interactivity_ to web pages in the browser.

*In short, ***JavaScript*** became a _hit_ because it turned _web browsers_ into _application platforms_. Here’s how:*

_+_ **JavaScript** can be used in both the _front-end_ and _back-end_ of _web development_;

_+_ **JavaScript** is standardized so it’s frequently updated with new versions;

_+_ **JavaScript** integrates easily with **HTML** and **CSS**;

_+_ **JavaScript** allows _websites_ to have ***interactivity*** like scroll transitions and object movement. Modern browsers still compete to process **JavaScript** the fastest for the best `user` experiences. _Chrome_, the most used _Internet browser_ in 2017, has been so successful because of its ability to process **JavaScript** quickly;

_+_ **JavaScript** offers a wide range of _frameworks_ and _libraries_ that help Developers create _complex applications_ with low overhead. Programmers can `import` `libraries` and `frameworks` in their `code` to augment their `application’s functionality`.


## **Requirement**
_-_ This _module_ requires no _modules_ outside of `Node.JS` core.
_-_ I will update the _module_ requires below as soon as whenever on our demand:
  - [Views](...)
  - [Panels](...)

## **Installation**
_-_ ***Install*** as you would normally _install_ a contributed _module_ of itself. 

## **Configuration**
_-_ The _module_ has no menu or modifiable settings. There is no configuration. When
enabled, the _module_ will **prevent** the _links_ from appearing. To **get** the _links_
back, **disable** the _module_ and **clear** _caches_.

## **Information for Developers**
_-_ The **Search API** provides a lot of ways for Developers to **extend** or **customize** the
_framework_.

## **Troubleshooting**
*Whether the menu does not display, check the following:*
_-_ Are the _"Access administration menu"_ and _"Use the administration pages and
  help"_ permissions enabled for the appropriate roles?
- Does `html.tpl.php` of your **theme output** the `$page_bottom` variable?

## **FAQ**

**Q: I want to prevent robots from indexing my custom error pages by
setting the robots meta tag in the HTML head to "noindex".**
**A:** There is no need. **Customerror** returns the correct `HTTP
status` codes _(403 and 404)_. This will prevent robots from indexing the
`error` pages.

**Q: I want to customize the custom error template output.**
**A:** In your theme template folder for your site, copy the template
provided by the **Customerror** module
(i.e. `templates/customerror.html.twig`) and then make your
modifications there.

**Q: I want to have a different template for my 404 and 403 pages.**
**A:** Copy `customerror.html.twig` to
`customerror--404.html.twig` and `customerror--403.html.twig`. You
do not need a `customerror.html.twig` for this to work.

## **Contribution**

to **discuss** what you would like to change.
