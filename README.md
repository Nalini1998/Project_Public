### **SOFTWARE ENGINEERING FOUNDATIONS**
# **Project: Fashion Blog**

Our friend Isa is a budding fashion blogger, and she asked us to build her a new website, just in time for **New York Fashion Week**!

Use our new HTML knowledge to create the underlying structure of the blog. Make sure to include plenty of pictures, links, lists, and other HTML elements that we’ve known so that her fans have plenty to read.

<br>

# **Tasks**

#### **1. Add the <html> element below**
To start, add the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration as the very first line of code at the top of the `index.html` file. Add the `<html>` element below.

<br>


#### **2. Add a \<head> element**
Below the `<html>` opening tag, add a `<head>` element. 

Below the `<head>` element, add the `<body>` element.

<br>

#### **3. Add a \<title> element**
Within the \<head> tags, add a \<title> element. Title the website `“Everyday with Isa”`.

<br>

#### **4. Add an \<h1>**
Directly below the opening `<body>` tag, add an `<h1>` that says:

```
“An Insider’s Guide to NYFW”
```

Below that, **add an `<h2>`** that says:

```
“Getting Tickets & Picking the Shows”
```

Below that, **add an `<h2>`** that says:

```
“Dressing for the Shows”
```

<br>

#### **5. Let's add a blog post**
_Here’s Isa's first dispatch from **Fashion Week**!_

Let's add a blog post. Between the `<h1>` and first `<h2>` tag, add a `<p>` tag that says:

```
"NYFW can be both amazingly fun & incredibly overwhelming, especially if you've never been. Luckily, I'm here to give you an insider's guide and make your first show a pleasurable experience. By taking my tips and tricks, and following your gut, you'll have an unforgettable experience!"
```

<br>

#### **6. Add another paragraph to the post using \<p>**
Between the first and second `<h2>` tags, add another paragraph to the post using the `<p>` tag:

```
"If you're lucky or connected you can get an invite, sans the price tag. But I wasn't so lucky or connected my first 2 years so I'm here to help you out. First, plan out which shows are most important to you and make a schedule and this is a biggie: SET A BUDGET. If you're worrying about blowing your cash the whole time you won't have fun. Then check out prices, days, and times and prioritize the designers you want to see most. Lastly, purchase your tickets and get excited!"
```

<br>

#### **7. Add a final paragraph**
After the last `<h2>` tag, add a final paragraph:
```
"Always be true to your own sense of style, if you don't you'll be uncomfortable the whole time and it will show. Remember, NYFW is about expressing yourself and taking in what the designers have chosen to express through their new lines. Also it's important to wear shoes you'll be comfortable in all day. Obviously you want to look good, but you'll be on your feet all day long, so be prepared."
```

<br>

#### **8. Add an \<img> tag and set its src**
_Of course, this wouldn't be a **Fashion Blog** without some images._

Above each paragraph, add an `<img>` tag and set its `src` to be one of the following links:

```
https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-html/elements-and-structure/image-one.jpeg
https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-html/elements-and-structure/image-two.jpeg
https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-html/elements-and-structure/image-three.jpeg
```

<br>

#### **9. Let's add an image of Isa**
_Our first blog post is complete!_

Now let's add an image of Isa, so her readers get to know her. Below the opening body tag, add an `<img>` tag with the following source:

```
https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-html/elements-and-structure/profile.jpg
```

<br>

#### **10. Below the \<img> tag, add an \<h3>**
Below the `<img>` tag, add an `<h3>` that says `"by Isabelle Rodriguez | 1 day ago"`

<br>

#### **11. Let's make a list of some related blog posts**
_Isa wants her readers to know that she's written a lot more than one post._

Let's make a list of some related blog posts. 

Beneath the last paragraph, add a `<h4>` tag that says `"Related Content"`. Underneath that header tag, create an unordered list.

<br>

#### **12. Add items into the unordered list** 
The unordered list should have the following four items:

```
"How To Style Boyfriend Jeans"
"When Print Is Too Much"
"The Overalls Trend"
"Fall’s It Color: Blush"
```

<br>

#### **13. Let's get Isa’s blog connected to the rest of the web!**
In the first paragraph, turn 'NYFW' into a link and have it go to: `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Fashion_Week`.

Make sure to include the `target="_blank"` attribute so that it opens in a new page.

<br>


#### **14. Add a new \<div> and set its id**
_Isa wants to make sure that her friends can get in touch with her._

At the bottom of our body, add a new `<div>` and set its `id='contact'`. 

Inside the `<div>`, create a new `<p>` tag and put the following contact information inside of it:

`email: isa@fashionblog.com | phone: 917-555-1098 | address: 371 284th St, New York, NY, 10001`

<br>

#### **15. Put the \<strong> tags around the contact information**
Inside the contact `<div>`, put `<strong>` opening and closing tags around `"email"`, `"phone"`, and `"address"`.

<br>

#### **16. Let's make the profile picture a link to the contact section of the webpage**

Find the profile `<img>` tag, and surround it by opening and closing `<a>` tags. In the `<a>` tag, set `href="#contact"`.

<br>

#### **17. Extra Tasks: Adding more content**

_Congrats! We've got the beginnings of a solid **Fashion Blog**._ 

Feel free to make modifications and practice our HTML by adding more content.
